IoT Hardware Set-up Steps

* In ZooVannaAdmin Front End App:
 1. Add Hub
        ⁃ View All Customer Facility > View Toilet >  Hubs > Add Hub
        ⁃ Name: QY Hub

* Set up Raspberry Pi
 2.  Obtain backend server IP and port (for step 4, eg. 172.168.0.1 and 3000) 
 3. ssh/VNC into pi to start server.
         - ssh pi@raspberrypi2.local 
         ⁃ password: raspberry
 4. create/edit .env file that contains (Might want to install vim)
          - this hub's name (as created in admin backend)
          - server's IP (from step 2) and server port
          - comport for microbit 
          - CAMERA_NAME for camera name to be created
 5. Activate environment "source ~/tflite/bin/activate"
 6. Run files (python3 detect.py & python3 image_show.py)
 7. Open another terminal to run "python3 hub.py"
 8. Additional information 
          - SECRET file is generated when hub is connected. Re-running the hub without deleting this file would allow the PI to reconnect with backend server at any point of time.
 9. To kill camera processes do "ps", look for python PID and "kill <PID>"

Set up microbit
7. Change controller file sensor name and type. (Will only be identified if registered on Backend server)
8. Download hex into microbit.

In ZooVannaAdmin Front End App:
 9. Add Sensor
         ⁃ View “QY Hub” > Add Sensor
  ⁃ Name: temp1 / light1
         ⁃ Sensor Type: temperature / light
  - Name: camera2
         - Sensor Type: camera
 10. Able to see sensors data coming in
